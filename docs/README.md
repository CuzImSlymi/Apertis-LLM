## Introduction

Apertis represents a significant advancement in LLM architecture design, combining the strengths of existing approaches while addressing their limitations. The architecture was developed with several key goals in mind:

- **Linear-Time Processing**: Achieve O(n) time complexity for both training and inference
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maintain constant memory usage regardless of sequence length
- **Multimodal Integration**: Native support for both text and image inputs
- **Simplicity**: Easy-to-use interfaces for training and inference
- **Modularity**: Cleanly separated components for easy modification and extension
- **Performance**: State-of-the-art reasoning capabilities with fewer parameters

Apertis draws inspiration from several existing architectures, including Transformers (attention mechanisms), Mamba (state space models), RWKV (linear attention), and Mixtral (mixture of experts), while introducing novel components and optimizations that enable superior performance and efficiency.

## Architecture Overview

The Apertis architecture consists of several innovative components that work together to provide a powerful and efficient language model:

### Selective Linear Attention (SLA)

The core innovation of Apertis is the Selective Linear Attention mechanism, which combines:
- Linear attention from RWKV for O(n) scaling
- Selective state processing from Mamba for dynamic adaptation
- Multi-head structure from Transformers for parallel feature extraction

This mechanism enables Apertis to process sequences in linear time while maintaining the powerful contextual understanding capabilities of traditional attention-based models.

### Adaptive Expert System (AES)

Inspired by Mixtral's Mixture of Experts, but with key improvements:
- Dynamic expert count based on input complexity
- Hierarchical routing for more efficient expert utilization
- Shared base parameters with specialized expert extensions
- Continuous expert weighting rather than discrete selection

This system allows Apertis to allocate computational resources more efficiently, focusing on complex inputs while processing simpler inputs with less computation.

### Unified Multimodal Encoder (UME)

A novel approach to handling both text and images:
- Shared representation space for text and visual tokens
- Modality-specific preprocessing followed by unified processing
- Cross-modal attention for relating text and image elements
- Adaptive resolution for efficient image processing

This encoder enables Apertis to process and understand both text and images in a unified manner, supporting true multimodal reasoning.

### State Tracking Recurrent Cell (STRC)

A specialized recurrent cell that:
- Maintains state information across sequence processing
- Enables efficient inference without recomputation
- Supports both parallel (training) and sequential (inference) modes
- Implements selective state updates for important information

This component allows Apertis to maintain context efficiently during inference, avoiding the need to recompute attention for the entire sequence at each generation step.

## Core Components

### Model Structure

Each Apertis layer consists of:
1. Layer normalization
2. Selective Linear Attention block
3. Layer normalization
4. Adaptive Expert System block
5. State Tracking Recurrent Cell

The model supports different sizes:
- **Small**: 512 dimensions, 8 layers, 8 attention heads
- **Base**: 768 dimensions, 12 layers, 12 attention heads
- **Large**: 1024 dimensions, 24 layers, 16 attention heads

### Selective Linear Attention

The Selective Linear Attention mechanism is implemented as follows:

```python
class SelectiveLinearAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim: int, heads: int = 8, dim_head: int = 64, dropout: float = 0.0):
        super().__init__()
        inner_dim = dim_head * heads
        self.heads = heads
        self.dim_head = dim_head
        self.scale = dim_head ** -0.5
        
        # Projections for queries, keys, values
        self.to_q = nn.Linear(dim, inner_dim, bias=False)
        self.to_k = nn.Linear(dim, inner_dim, bias=False)
        self.to_v = nn.Linear(dim, inner_dim, bias=False)
        
        # Selective state parameters
        self.state_decay = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1, heads, 1, 1))
        self.state_threshold = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, heads, 1, 1))
        self.state_scale = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1, heads, 1, 1))
        
        # Output projection
        self.to_out = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(inner_dim, dim),
            nn.Dropout(dropout)
        )
```

The mechanism supports two modes of operation:
- **Sequential mode** for inference, which maintains state information
- **Parallel mode** for training, which processes all tokens simultaneously

### Adaptive Expert System

The Adaptive Expert System dynamically routes inputs to specialized experts:

```python
class AdaptiveExpertSystem(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self, 
        dim: int, 
        num_experts: int = 8, 
        expert_dim: int = 2048, 
        num_selected: int = 2,
        dropout: float = 0.0
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.num_experts = num_experts
        self.expert_dim = expert_dim
        self.num_selected = num_selected
        
        # Base model (shared across all inputs)
        self.base_model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(dim, dim),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Dropout(dropout),
            nn.Linear(dim, dim),
            nn.Dropout(dropout)
        )
        
        # Expert router
        self.router = nn.Linear(dim, num_experts)
        
        # Expert networks
        self.experts = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(dim, expert_dim),
                nn.GELU(),
                nn.Dropout(dropout),
                nn.Linear(expert_dim, dim),
                nn.Dropout(dropout)
            )
            for _ in range(num_experts)
        ])
```

The system selects the most relevant experts for each input, allowing the model to specialize in different aspects of language understanding.

### State Tracking Recurrent Cell

The State Tracking Recurrent Cell maintains state information across sequence processing:

```python
class StateTrackingRecurrentCell(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim: int, state_dim: int = None):
        super().__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.state_dim = state_dim or dim
        
        # State update parameters
        self.state_gate = nn.Linear(dim + self.state_dim, self.state_dim)
        self.state_update = nn.Linear(dim + self.state_dim, self.state_dim)
        
        # Output projection
        self.to_out = nn.Linear(self.state_dim, dim)
```

This cell enables efficient inference by maintaining a compressed representation of the sequence history.

## Multimodal Capabilities

Apertis provides native support for multimodal inputs, allowing the model to process and understand both text and images.

### Image Encoder

The Image Encoder converts images into embeddings:

```python
class ImageEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        embed_dim: int = 768,
        image_size: int = 224,
        patch_size: int = 16,
        channels: int = 3,
        dropout: float = 0.0,
        use_pretrained: bool = True
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.image_size = image_size
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.channels = channels
        
        # Calculate number of patches
        self.num_patches = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2
        
        # Option 1: Patch embedding with convolution
        self.patch_embedding = nn.Conv2d(
            in_channels=channels,
            out_channels=embed_dim,
            kernel_size=patch_size,
            stride=patch_size,
            bias=False
        )
        
        # Option 2: Use a pretrained vision backbone
        if use_pretrained:
            # Use a pretrained ResNet as the backbone
            resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
            # Remove the final classification layer
            self.backbone = nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[:-2])
            # Add a projection to match the embedding dimension
            self.projection = nn.Conv2d(2048, embed_dim, kernel_size=1)
        else:
            self.backbone = None
            self.projection = None
```

The encoder supports both a simple patch-based approach and a pretrained vision backbone for more powerful image understanding.

### Multimodal Fusion

The Multimodal Fusion module combines text and image embeddings:

```python
class MultimodalFusion(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        embed_dim: int = 768,
        num_heads: int = 12,
        dropout: float = 0.1
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        
        # Cross-attention for fusing modalities
        self.cross_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=embed_dim,
            num_heads=num_heads,
            dropout=dropout,
            batch_first=True
        )
```

This module enables the model to relate text and image elements, supporting tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal reasoning.

### Multimodal Processing

The multimodal processing pipeline consists of:
1. Image encoding into visual tokens
2. Text tokenization using byte-pair encoding
3. Modality-specific positional encoding
4. Cross-modal fusion through attention mechanisms
5. Unified processing through the main architecture

## Training Pipeline

        data_path: str,
        tokenizer: ApertisTokenizer,
        max_length: int = 1024,
        multimodal: bool = False,
        image_dir: Optional[str] = None,
        image_processor = None
    ):
        self.data_path = data_path
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.multimodal = multimodal
        self.image_dir = image_dir
        self.image_processor = image_processor
        
        # Load data
        with open(data_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
