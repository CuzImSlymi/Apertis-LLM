# Architecture Design of Apertis LLM

This document provides a technical overview of the Apertis LLM architecture, explaining its innovative components and design decisions.

## Core Architecture

Apertis combines the strengths of several state-of-the-art architectures while addressing their limitations:

### Selective Linear Attention (SLA)

Traditional transformer attention has O(nÂ²) complexity, making it inefficient for long sequences. Apertis introduces Selective Linear Attention with:

- O(n) time complexity for efficient processing
- Adaptive selection of important tokens
- Linear projection of attention patterns
- Efficient memory usage even for long contexts

### Adaptive Expert System (AES)

Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures like Mixtral, but with improvements:

- Dynamic routing of tokens to specialized expert networks
- Efficient parameter usage through conditional computation
- Automatic specialization of experts during training
- Reduced computational overhead compared to traditional MoE

### State Tracking Recurrent Cell (STRC)

Combines benefits of RNN-like architectures (like RWKV) with transformer capabilities:

- Efficient state tracking for sequential processing
- Reduced memory usage during inference
- Fast inference on CPU devices
- Maintains context across very long sequences

### Unified Multimodal Encoder (UME)

Enables seamless processing of both text and images:

- Joint embedding space for text and visual information
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Efficient image patch processing
- Unified representation for multimodal reasoning

## Implementation Details

### Model Sizes

Apertis comes in three standard sizes:

| Size  | Parameters | Hidden Size | Layers | Heads | Intermediate Size |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Small | ~350M      | 512         | 8      | 8     | 2048             |
| Base  | ~1.3B      | 768         | 12     | 12    | 3072             |
| Large | ~6.7B      | 1024        | 24     | 16    | 4096             |

### Attention Implementation

The Selective Linear Attention mechanism is implemented as:

```python
def selective_linear_attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    # Project queries and keys to selection space
    selection_weights = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(query.size(-1))
    
    # Apply mask if provided
    if mask is not None:
        selection_weights = selection_weights.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    
    # Select top-k keys for each query
    top_k_weights, top_k_indices = selection_weights.topk(k=min(selection_weights.size(-1), 256), dim=-1)
    top_k_weights = F.softmax(top_k_weights, dim=-1)
    
    # Gather selected values and compute weighted sum
    gathered_values = torch.gather(value, -2, top_k_indices.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, -1, -1, value.size(-1)))
    output = torch.matmul(top_k_weights.unsqueeze(-2), gathered_values).squeeze(-2)
    
    return output
```

### Expert System Implementation

The Adaptive Expert System dynamically routes tokens to specialized experts:

```python
def route_tokens(tokens, router, experts, num_selected=2):
    # Compute routing probabilities
    routing_logits = router(tokens)  # [batch, seq_len, num_experts]
    routing_probs = F.softmax(routing_logits, dim=-1)
    
    # Select top experts per token
    top_probs, top_indices = routing_probs.topk(num_selected, dim=-1)
    top_probs = top_probs / top_probs.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)  # Normalize
    
    # Process tokens with selected experts
    expert_outputs = torch.zeros_like(tokens)
    for i, expert in enumerate(experts):
        # Create mask for tokens routed to this expert
        expert_mask = (top_indices == i).any(dim=-1).unsqueeze(-1)
        # Process only tokens routed to this expert
        if expert_mask.any():
            expert_outputs += expert_mask * expert(tokens)
    
    return expert_outputs
```
